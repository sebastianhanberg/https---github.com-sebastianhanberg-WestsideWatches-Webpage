        Once upon a time, there were three guys that started in the same class in August 2020.
        Days turned into weeks and they became good friends. They were all a bit different from each other.
        But one thing they did have in common was making websites, watches, saving the earth and that they
        all sat on the left side of the classroom. That is how the idea of Westside Watches began.

        On westside watches we care about fashion and watches. But most important, we care about our time on earth. 
        Today we have plenty of difficulties revesing our effects on the planet, and that's something we want to help with. 
        therefore we had the great idea. For every watch sold we will plant one tree.

    Trees are good for our planet. They create the air that we breathe and filter out air pollution.
    Thats not all, trees also help to reduce the ozone levels in urban areas. 
    They also help us to remove carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the air.
